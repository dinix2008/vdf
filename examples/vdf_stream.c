/*
This example will connect to a URL using libcurl and stream the data. It is designed to work with an MP3 stream.
The data will be provided as a never-ending file on the FAT drive. If data underflows, a 512-byte block of silent
MP3 is output to the file. If no data is read from the file and the data overflows, the circular buffer data is overwritten.

This is a fairly simple implementation and both dumb and unoptimised. Also, both the transport side and the curl
side simply sit in a loop until the process is killed rather than only making the connections when needed.
