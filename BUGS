  Drive size calculations and filesystem type detection sometimes gets things
    wrong.

  Drives with sizes > 2^32 needs testing and doesn't seem to work fully.

  The sector/cluster offset and size types aren't always used where they should
    be.

  Autotools stuff is probably a bit wrong. Ie. config.h isn't really used.

  No big-endian support yet.
